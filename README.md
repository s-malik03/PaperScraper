# PaperScraper
Can get all relevant sources from the web from a PDF document

To use:

You must have tesseract installed (can be downloaded from https://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/tesseract/)

Your executable/python script must be in the same director as config.txt

You must insert the path to your tesseract.exe in config.txt

Notes:

This is not 100% accurate and will provide some strange links, however relevant links can be manually filtered out

In case you want to search manually, a text version of the pdf will always be generated
